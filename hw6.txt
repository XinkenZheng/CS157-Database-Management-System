Transactions


1.


a.Nonserializable behavior is possible because the two select statements in Tranction 1 will be runned both before and after transaction 2.
b.No, nonserializable behavior is not possible because the state of S unchanged before and after tranaction 2.
c.Yes, nonserializable behavior is possible because the first and the third statements of Transaction 1 is executed before and after Transaction 2.

2.
a. since T2 is also serializible, it is allowed to read only committed data by T1, so we could get the pair(25,25) (40,40)
b. if t2 is repeatable read, update in T1 is not allowed to update unless we rollback t2,so we could get(25,25) (40,40)
c. if t2 is read committed,reads are only allowed after the transactions are completed, so we could get(25,25) (25,40) (40,40)
d. if t2 is read uncommitted, dirty reads are allowed, which means we can read before t1 commits which might give,(25,25) (25,30) (25,40) (30,30) (30,40) (40,40)

3.
a. the weakest isolation level needed for transaction T to ensure that queries Q1 and Q2 will always get the same result is Read-Uncommitted
b. the weakest isolation level needed for transaction T to ensure that queries Q1 and Q2 will always get the same result is Repeatable-Read
c. the weakest isolation level needed for transaction T to ensure that queries Q1 and Q2 will always get the same result is Serializable
d. Only a will guaranteed to always get the same result for Q1 and Q2
